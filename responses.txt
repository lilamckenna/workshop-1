Question 1:
I think i might be able to use bootstrap in the future when I have a genius startup idea and need to pull together a webpage super fast.
Or, more realistically perhaps, I might be able to use bootstrap when pitching an idea for a hackathon, or in jobs in the real world when time matters.

Question 2:
Using bootstrap in the industry could get tricky if you are getting paid to make your web dev look amazing then you prooooooobably should not use bootstrap.
No that original!!
